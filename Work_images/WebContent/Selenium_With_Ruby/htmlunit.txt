Htmlunit:

This is currently the fastest and most lightweight implementation of WebDriver.
 As the name suggests, this is based on HtmlUnit. HtmlUnit is a java based 
implementation of a WebBrowser without a GUI. For any language binding 
(other than java) the Selenium Server is required to use this driver.

Language:Ruby
driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url => "http://localhost:4444/wd/hub", 
:desired_capabilities => :htmlunit

Pros

    Fastest implementation of WebDriver
    A pure Java solution and so it is platform independent.
    Supports JavaScript

Cons

    Emulates other browsers’ JavaScript behaviour (see below)

1.driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox

2.
profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new
profile.native_events = true
driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile => profile
