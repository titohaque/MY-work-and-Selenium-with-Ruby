What is selenium?
Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web applications.
Selenium provides a record/playback tool for authoring tests without
learning a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a
 test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number 
of popular programming languages, including Java, C#, Groovy, Perl, PHP, 
Python and Ruby. The tests can then be run against most modern web browser
 Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh platforms.

Types of Selenium:
1.Selenium 2(aka,Selenium Webdriver)
2.Selenium 1 (aka. Selenium RC or Remote Control
3.Selenium IDE
4.Selenium-Grid

1.Selenium 2(aka,Selenium Webdriver):
WebDriver will run the browser directly.

2.Selenium 1 (aka. Selenium RC or Remote Control
Selenium RC was the main Selenium project for a long time, before the
WebDriver/Selenium merge brought up Selenium 2, the newest and more powerful tool.
3.Selenium IDE:
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a prototyping tool for 
building test scripts. It is a Firefox plugin and provides an easy-to-use 
interface for developing automated tests. Selenium IDE has a recording feature,
 which records user actions as they are performed and then exports them as a 
reusable script in one of many programming languages that can be later executed.

4.Selenium-Grid
Selenium-Grid allows the Selenium RC solution to scale for large test 
suites and for test suites that must be run in multiple environments.


How Does WebDriver ‘Drive’ the Browser Compared to Selenium-RC?

1. Selenium-WebDriver makes direct calls to the browser using each browser’s 
native support for automation.

2.  It ‘injected’ javascript functions into the browser when the browser 
was loaded and then used its javascript to drive the AUT within the browser.

WebDriver and the Selenium-Server:

If you will be only using the WebDriver API you do not need the 
Selenium-Server

There are some reasons though to use the Selenium-Server with Selenium-WebDriver:
 1.You are using Selenium-Grid to distribute your tests over multiple machines 
or virtual machines (VMs).
2.You want to connect to a remote machine that has a particular browser 
version that is not on your current machine.
3.You are not using the Java bindings (i.e. Python, C#, or Ruby) and would 
like to use HtmlUnit Driver

HtmlUnit Driver:
This is currently the fastest and most lightweight implementation of WebDriver.
 As the name suggests, this is based on HtmlUnit. HtmlUnit is a java based 
implementation of a WebBrowser without a GUI. For any language binding (other
 than java) the Selenium Server is required to use this driver.
